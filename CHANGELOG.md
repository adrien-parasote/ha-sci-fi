# Changelog

# [1.3.0](https://github.com/adrien-parasote/ha-sci-fi/releases/tag/1.3.0) - 2026-06-02

## 🆕 What's New

- **Workbench — Icon Browser**: new integrated icon browser in the workbench dev tool. Browse and copy `sci:` custom icons and `mdi:` icons inline without leaving the page. Includes the HA entity picker API integration.

## 💫 Enhancements

- **Bridge card — actions section**: removed legacy `call_kids` component; replaced by a clean, decoupled `actions` section in the YAML config.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **i18n — Bridge editor**: migrate all FR `msg()` calls to `getLabel()` with EN keys. Adds 55 missing FR translation entries.
- **i18n — Stove**: add missing `section-title-stove` key to the `getLabel` dictionary.
- **Workbench — mock hass `entity_id`**: `buildMockHass` now injects `entity_id` on all mock state objects, fixing editors that call `Object.values(hass.states).filter(e => e.entity_id…)`.
- **Workbench — GUI editor remount**: switching back from YAML tab to GUI tab now correctly remounts the editor.

## 🛠️ Technical

- Coverage: tests added to meet 80%/75% branch/function thresholds.
- Codemaps updated for Bridge v1.3 cycle.

## 📚 Docs

- Full documentation audit: language consistency (EN), urbanization, and structural alignment across all specs, ADRs, blueprints, cards, and codemaps.
- All card docs (`docs/cards/`) rewritten with accurate field names (verified against `src/types/config.ts`), complete options tables, and standard format.
- `docs/cards/guidelines.md` relocated to `docs/guidelines.md` (developer reference, not a card usage doc).
- Spec Gate: 202 PASS / 0 PARTIAL / 0 FAIL across all 202 spec checks.


# [1.2.3](https://github.com/adrien-parasote/ha-sci-fi/releases/tag/1.2.3) - 2026-05-29

## 🐛 Fixes
- **i18n & Localization**: fix critical minification bug where Terser collapsed symmetric `msg()` ternary calls (e.g. `isOn ? msg('A') : msg('B')`) into a single dynamic call, bypassing `lit-localize` static parsing and causing toast notifications and status values to always display in English when French was active. Rewrote calls as static tuple accessors (`[msg('OFF'), msg('ON')][isOn ? 1 : 0]`) across TV Remote, Water Management, and Plugs cards.

# [1.2.2](https://github.com/adrien-parasote/ha-sci-fi/releases/tag/1.2.2) - 2026-05-29

## 🐛 Fixes
- **Water card**: use native `ha-state-icon` for sensors to correctly inherit dynamic HA device class icons (like batteries).
- **Water & Lights cards**: fix `first_floor_to_render` not working (or resolving improperly on first render) when passing the friendly name (e.g. `Extérieur`) instead of the exact `floor_id`. Case-insensitivity and friendly-name mapping is now fully supported.
# [v1.2.1](https://github.com/adrien-parasote/ha-sci-fi/releases/tag/1.2.1) - 2026-05-29

## 🐛 Fixes
- **Water card**: fix double-fire event on `sf-toggle-change` causing UI toggle glitches.
- **Water card**: support `input_select` virtual entities in dropdowns (like filtration modes) by dynamically inferring HA service domain.
- **Hexa tiles**: add native support for the `water` entity kind to allow aggregating water cards into standalone tiles.

# [v1.2.0](https://github.com/adrien-parasote/ha-sci-fi/releases/tag/1.2.0) - 2026-05-29

## 🆕 What's New

**Splashdown**: adding water management 💧 card.

### 💧 Water Management Card (`sci-fi-water-management`)
Introducing the brand-new Water Management card! Track and control your irrigation, hydroponic systems, and soil moisture with a high-fidelity Sci-Fi interface.
- **Dynamic Hexa Tiles**: Seamlessly groups your water sensors and actuators into intuitive accordion structures mapped to their parent device.
- **Standalone Automations**: Beautifully distinct cards specifically for Home Assistant automations (`automation.`), grouped together.
- **Visibility Toggles**: A dedicated configuration UI allows you to individually toggle the visibility of any mapped sensor.
- **Wildcard Exclusions**: Support for wildcards (e.g., `*temperature*`) to dynamically ignore irrelevant entities and keep the UI clean.
- **Balanced Visual Integration**: Built from the ground up to support premium animations, fluid layouts, and seamless alignment with the overall Sci-Fi theme.

### 📺 TV Card Testing Updates
- **Sony Bravia Validated**: The TV remote card documentation now explicitly notes that it has been fully tested and validated with Sony Bravia TVs using the official Sony integration. D-pad commands map perfectly out of the box.

### 🌍 i18n & Localization Enhancements
- Full French localization (i18n) support implemented for the new Water Management card and its editor.
- Fixed a silent failure within the `lit-localize` build pipeline where missing `<target>` tags defaulted UI elements back to English in the final build.
- Updated UI components so that localization values are correctly extracted via custom string accessors (`getLabel()`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Refactoring
- Cleaned up floating promise warnings within `sci-fi-water-management.ts`.
- Removed unused local variables in the editor configuration code.
- Added `L073` to the continuous learning registry to document robust `lit-localize` translation patterns.
- `sci-fi-water-management` added to the internal Frontend Codemap documentation.

🖲 Vacuum card

Card configuration need to be updated due to several factors : allow to have multiple vacuum in same card, sensor deletion, update and addition:

- `last_clean_area` & `last_clean_duration` are removed
- Adding `battery` & `mop_intensite` sensors

Easiest way to update is to save your current information and recreate the card from the UI.
